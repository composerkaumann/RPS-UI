## My goals

- Practice DOM creation with Javascript: everything between "body" tags is created with JS.
- Should work with big and small screen sizes.
- If you search for ideas and solutions on stackoverflow or similar sites, try to see different methods and understand how it works. If you use some of those ideas in your assignment- throrough understanding is essential.
- All buttons should also be accessible from keyboard: create the code and conditions when the specific key should work. Keys shoul not work when ctrl, alt or cmd are held on PC or MAC.
- Try to use different kinds of loops, cases, logical operators.
