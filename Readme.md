## My goals

- Practice DOM creation with Javascript: everything between "body" tags is created with JS.
- Should work with big and small screen sizes.
- Use global variables as little as possible. Two were left: global scores for human and computer. Those can be also in functions somehow. Maybe trying later.
- If you search for ideas and solutions on stackoverflow or similar sites, try to see different methods and understand how they work. If you use some of those ideas in your assignment- throrough understanding is essential.
- All buttons should also be accessible from keyboard: create the code and conditions when the specific key should work. Keys should not work when ctrl, alt or cmd are held on PC or MAC.
- Try to use different kinds of loops, cases, logical operators.
- UI: simple and clean. When the button is not clickable/necessary, it must dissapear etc.
- Keep your code tidy.

## I tried not to

- Waste time on editing images and putting them in the project. Next time...
- Get too complicated- this was very hard because my skills aren't good but one idea leads to another.
